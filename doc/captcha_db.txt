//============================================================

---------------------------------------

Id: Unique ID.

---------------------------------------

Filename: Name of the BMP image file (with location).
		  The path of the file can be different for each captcha image, but it's best practice to keep them in the same directory.

Example:
    Filename: db/captcha/rathena.bmp

---------------------------------------

Answer: Correct answer for the captcha (case-sensitive).

---------------------------------------

Bonus: NPC script that is ran when a captcha is successfully answered. Accepts script constants, player variables, and a player variable
	   CAPTCHA_RETRIES. This variable can be used within the Bonus script to get the remaining retries a player has. Coupled with the
	   script command 'getbattleflag()' this could be used to assign different bonuses based on success rate.

Example:
    # Give level 10 Blessing for 20 minutes with no failures, else give for 30 seconds.
    Bonus: >
      if (CAPTCHA_RETRIES == getbattleflag("macro_detection_retry") {
        specialeffect2 EF_BLESSING;
        sc_start SC_BLESSING,1200000,10;
      } else {
        specialeffect2 EF_BLESSING;
        sc_start SC_BLESSING,30000,10;
      }
